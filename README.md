Dear Pi Network Community,I hope this message finds you well. 

As we continue to grow and evolve, I want to express my gratitude for your dedication and belief in the vision of Pi. 

Together, we are building something truly special—an inclusive digital economy that empowers individuals around the globe.

Your commitment to securing and validating the network has been the cornerstone of our progress. 

As we move closer to launching the open mainnet, I encourage everyone to stay engaged, continue mining, and help spread the word about Pi's potential.

Let's keep pushing forward, sharing ideas, and supporting one another. 

The future of Pi is bright, and it's because of each one of you.

Thank you for being a part of this journey.

Best regards,

Pi Network Team...
